# Release Announcement v1.7.0

We are pleased to announce that the Apache YuniKorn community has voted to release 1.7.0.
Apache YuniKorn is a standalone resource scheduler, designed for managing and scheduling Batch and Data workloads on container
orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes for on-prem and on-cloud use cases.

## Overview

The Apache YuniKorn community has resolved 168 [JIRAs](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?filter=12353609) in this release.

Release manager: Peter Bacsko

Release date: 2025-07-28

## Highlights

### Kubernetes 1.32 support

Apache YuniKorn 1.7.0 add supports for Kubernetes 1.32. See [YUNIKORN-2996](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2996) for details.

### Latest in-place pod vertical scaling support

Modifying pod resource usage in-place is now supported according to the latest spec (alpha in v1.32).
See [YUNIKORN-3053](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-3053) for details.

### Pod level resources limits support (KEP-2837)

With Kubernetes 1.32, it's possible to set resource limits on a pod level instead of a container level.
See [YUNIKORN-3039](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-3039) for details.

### GOGC / GOMEMLIMIT can be adjusted in the helm chart

Two environment variables, GOGC and GOMEMLIMIT are now easy to modify in the helm chart.
See [YUNIKORN-3000](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-3000) for details.

### Proper tracking of non-Yunikorn (foreign) pods

Before 1.7.0, only the total resource usage of foreign pods has been tracked. With the new release, Apache YuniKorn properly tracks non-Yunikorn pods in the scheduler core,
enhancing supportability. Pods scheduled by different schedulers are listed in the REST response when doing state dump or listing nodes.
See [YUNIKORN-2791](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2791) for details.

### Metrics improvements

Metrics for scheduling cycle and node evaluation was added in [YUNIKORN-2930](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2930). Metric for maxRunningApps was added
in [YUNIKORN-2854](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2854).
